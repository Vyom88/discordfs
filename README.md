# discordfs

Discord's search bar leaves much to be desired when searching for files. You can search for files with `has:file`, but you can't search **by filename** or **file content**. That's what `discordfs` aims to solve.

With `discordfs`, you can search for files in your server **by filename** with `/search [filename]`! (Searching by **file content** is coming soon!) 

Files you upload are *immediately* indexed so that you can search for files as soon as you send them.

Use the last working version [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=837345172105723985&permissions=2147593280&scope=bot%20applications.commands).

The testing version of this bot was recently up but I took it down to make sure it performed as expected.

## Commands

I really like Discord's Slash Commands, so the bot supports older commands (Ex. `!all`) and slash commands (Ex. `/all`)

- `/search [filename]` : Search for a file by its filename. Check out [search options](#search-options) to narrow your search! (Also supports: `!fsearch`, `!s`, `!search`, `!fs`)
- `/all` : Display all files that the bot can access (Also supports: `!all`, `!a`)
- `/clear` : Clear all files from the index (This doesn't delete any files/messages in the actual server) (Also supports: `!clear`, `!c`)
- `/remove [filename]` : Remove the bot's access to files named `filename` (Also supports: `!remove`, `!rm`)
- `/delete [filename]` : Remove the bot's access to files named `filename` AND delete their respective messages (Also supports: `!delete`, `!del`)

## Search Options

You can narrow your search by specifying options!
- File name: Searching for files by filenames is **currently** the cool part of discordfs, so this is the only required option in the option list. (That might change in the coming weeks ;)
- File type
- Author
- Channel
- Message Content (file content coming soon!)
- After / Before / During
